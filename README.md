# NASA SPACEAPPS CHALLENGE - PROJECT
> from the Space for Change challenge of the NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon. 

## 1. Project Title: **Justice Storm**
## Summary
*Justice Storm* arises from the need to find vulnerable areas that have been devastated by natural disasters. Initially, our web application focuses on the perspective of the before and after the hurricanes in Mexico, which impact different communities and are of different magnitudes. Therefore, we seek to provide access to truthful, dynamic and quality information that, when passing the filter of our data analysis, exposes areas that have not yet been heard derived from demographic and socioeconomic aspects. In addition, we highlight that our web application is designed to capture data in real time, that is, we are able to analyze positive and / or negative feelings in users who make tweets about natural disasters using *Hashtags*.

## 2. Detailed Project Description
The solution that we have proposed for the Space for Change challenge is based on the use of technologies, since we know the high impact, scope and easy access that they provide in the height and breadth of the world, apart from that, we faithfully believe that technology It can also contribute to the injustice, environment and society part and generate changes in favor of the above.

According to this, we have created a prototype of our solution as a web application, which is a digital tool to provide, initially, to the citizens of the Mexican territory an informative, interactive, visual and dynamic space about the impact that exists. against natural disasters, specifically tropical cyclones (hurricanes) which are very common in Mexico. Said information is presented in such a way that anyone, without the need for knowledge in data analysis and technology, can observe and understand the demographic and socioeconomic impact existing in the country's entities that have been affected by this kind of phenomenon and make a comparison. among these to demonstrate the existing injustices according to the analysis of said variables. For example, we can assume that post-disaster recovery in vulnerable areas or indigenous territory is much slower than in the nation's capital.

Although this assumption may be real or it may be a lie, data analytics will be our best friend to be able to observe and interpret this kind of injustice that involves us all, taking data from NASA for the knowledge of the cyclone, the route and satellite images.

Although, in our prototype we only rescue tropical cyclones, the purpose and scope of being able to add disasters such as: fires, droughts, floods, etc.

Apart from this analysis, a gallery of images of the affected areas and previous information are presented within an interactive map, in which the level of impact is displayed, denoted by colored indicators according to the affected states and the breakdown of detailed information. about the analysis of the injustices detected after the disaster.

As this digital tool is designed by the citizens for the citizens, we clarify that our solution has purposes, first of all, informative purposes that later lead to reflection and decision-making that allow reducing the social and environmental inequalities that exist in Mexico; believing that this information will be highly useful to encourage the participation and creation of non-profit organizations for the correction and prevention of environmental injustices.

That said, we recognize the importance of the voices of citizenship in a nation, therefore, we have integrated the possibility of being able to know in real time the analysis of feelings according to the opinions on social networks, specifically Twitter, the hashtag environment to the natural disaster and show it in a visual and understandable way.

Finally, our aim is to provide transparency and access to truthful, analyzed and easily understood information for all.

For the development of the tool, technologies for web development (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery), data analytics, sentiment analysis based on Azure cloud services and visualization tools in PowerBI, APIs consumption were used.
